Perfect! Here's the complete file list you need to transfer the shopping list system to your new project: 📦

🗂️ Core Shopping List Files:
1. Main Shopping List Page:
client/src/pages/ShoppingListMasterView.tsx

The master shopping list with grocery delivery options

2. Store Files (State Management):
client/src/stores/shoppingListStore.ts
client/src/stores/otherItemsStore.ts

LocalStorage-based stores for meal ingredients and other items (household, personal care, etc.)

3. Component Files:
client/src/components/AddOtherItems.tsx
client/src/components/ShoppingAggregateBar.tsx
client/src/components/ShoppingListSummaryButton.tsx

What they do:

AddOtherItems: The "Add Other Items" section (paper towels, dog food, etc.)
ShoppingAggregateBar: Bottom bar with "Copy List" + "Add to Shopping List" buttons (used on meal boards)
ShoppingListSummaryButton: Individual "Shopping" button on meal cards with preview modal
4. Utility Files:
client/src/utils/ingredientParser.ts
client/src/utils/ingredientAggregator.ts

What they do:

ingredientParser: Parses quantities (1/2, ½, 2 cups, etc.) and ingredient strings
ingredientAggregator: Combines duplicate ingredients, normalizes units, handles aggregation logic
5. Router Configuration:
Add this route in Router.tsx:

<Route path="/shopping-list-v2" component={ShoppingListMasterView} />

🔗 How Shopping Buttons Throughout App Connect:
AthleteBoard, WeeklyMealBoard, CompetitionBeachbodyBoard → Use <ShoppingAggregateBar /> at bottom
Individual meal cards → Use <ShoppingListSummaryButton /> button
All buttons → Import functions from shoppingListStore.ts (addItems, readList, etc.)
Navigation → All redirect to /shopping-list-v2 after adding items
